/**
 * Every type in the system, and nothing else.
 *
 * One file declares every interface and type alias; modules import their types
 * from here and export only values. Two properties pay for the indirection:
 *
 *  - **It exports no runtime value.** That is what lets `src/core/**` import it
 *    without importing a sibling layer — an `import type` is erased before a
 *    module graph exists, so a core file that names a type declared next to a
 *    hook's still has no edge to `src/hooks/`. `tests/namespace.test.ts`
 *    enforces both halves: no type declared outside this file, and no value
 *    declared inside it. Add a `const` here and core's purity boundary quietly
 *    becomes a lie.
 *  - **It is the whole vocabulary in one place.** A type inferred from a
 *    runtime value — a Zod schema, the hook-kind list — is still declared here,
 *    against a type-position import of the value it is inferred from. Those
 *    imports are erased too, so the cycle they look like they create (this file
 *    names `runtimeConfigSchema`, `src/config/schema.ts` names `RuntimeConfig`)
 *    never exists at runtime.
